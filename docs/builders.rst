needs
-----
.. versionadded:: 0.1.30

The **needs** builder exports all found needs to a single json file.

The build creates a folder **needs** and a file called **needs.json** inside a given build-folder.

Usage
+++++

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build -b needs source_dir build_dir

History data
++++++++++++

The builder stores the needs under a version, which is taken from your conf.py.

If a **needs.json** is imported (see :ref:`needs_file`) and you raise the documentation version, the new version is stored beside the old
version(s) inside the **needs.json**.

.. hint::
   If you generate and store/archive (e.g. in git) the **needs.json** file
   every time you raise your documentation version, you will get nice history data.

Format
++++++

.. code-block:: python
