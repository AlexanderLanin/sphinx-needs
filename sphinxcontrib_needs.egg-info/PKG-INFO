Description: 
        This package contains the needs Sphinx extension.
        
        It allows the definition of needs/requirements, the listing of defined needs in lists and the reference of defined
        needs in doc strings of implementation code or tests.
        
        A need is described by the following attributes:
        
         * id: unique identifier
         * need: Short description of the need
         * status: A status of the need, like open, in discussion, implemented (optional)
         * category: A category for the need, e.g. to separate needs of different libraries, function, ...
        
        This extension provides the following directives:
        
         * *need*: Define a single need
         * *needlist*: Shows a list of defined needs. Can be filtered by name, status, category
         * *needref*: Defines a reference to a defined need, e.g. to link to the implementation or test case of the need.
